# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# CodeQL Analysis Workflow - Frontend
#
# Purpose:
# Runs static security and quality analysis on frontend TypeScript code
# using GitHub CodeQL.
#
# Triggers:
# - On every push to any branch
# - On pull requests targeting `main` or `development`
# - On a scheduled weekly scan (every Monday at 07:00 UTC)
#
# What this workflow does:
# 1. Checks out repository code
# 2. Installs project dependencies
# 3. Initializes CodeQL with a custom configuration
# 4. Executes CodeQL analysis
#
# Security:
# - Grants permission to upload security events (SARIF results)
# - Reads packages if needed for dependency resolution
#
# Notes:
# - Uses a custom config file located at:
#   .github/codeql/codeql-config.yml
# - Designed for frontend TypeScript projects
# - Intended to enforce continuous security scanning in CI

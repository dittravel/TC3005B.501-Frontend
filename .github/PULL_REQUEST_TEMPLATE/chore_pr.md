Chore Pull Request Template

Use this template for maintenance-related changes that do NOT directly
implement user-facing functionality or user stories.

Chores typically include:
- Code formatting and linting
- Documentation updates
- Refactoring with no functional change
- Configuration updates
- Dependency upgrades
- Build / tooling improvements

Rules:
- Must be linked to a standalone `chore` Task issue
- Must follow conventional commits (style, docs, refactor, chore)
- Must originate from `development`
- Must target the `development` branch

This ensures:
- Clean project history
- Clear separation between features and maintenance
- Stable development workflow

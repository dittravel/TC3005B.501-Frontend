# Sub-Task Issue Template
# Use this template for highly specific, focused units of work that
# contribute toward completing a larger Task.
#
# Sub-Tasks should:
# - Be small and independently completable
# - Be assignable to a single individual where possible
# - Have clearly defined scope and outcome
# - Roll up into a parent Task
#
# This template automatically:
# - Prefixes the issue title with [Sub-Task]
# - Adds the issue to the dittravel project board
